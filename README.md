<h1>Growth</h1>

<p>
The idea from which this app was born is to help people to follow a routine of daily habits. 
I tried to replicate the same app that I wrote in <a href="https://github.com/MichelaDA97/MorningGrowth.git">SwiftUI</a>.

In particular, in this project I focused my attention on the UIKit framework and on passing data from SwiftUI to UIKit. 

The main features of this app are:
- Add activities with a title and duration.
- Track completed activities by checking them off.
- View and manage your daily routine.
- Delete individual activities or clear the entire list.
- Move tasks between each other to prioritize.

<h2>Usage:</h2>

- **Adding Activities**: Tap the "+" button to add a new activity. Enter the title and duration of the activity (if you don't set the name and/or the time, an alert appears on your screen, only when you close the alert and fill in the empty fields, you can save your own habit), then tap "Save".
  
- **Checking off Activities**: Tap on an activity in the list to mark it as completed. The checkbox next to the activity will toggle between filled (completed) and empty (not completed).
  
- **Deleting Activities**: Swipe left on an activity to reveal the delete button. Tap the delete button to remove the activity from the list.

- **Deleting All Activities**: Tap the "Delete All" button in the navigation bar to remove all activities from the list. A confirmation alert will appear before deleting all activities.
