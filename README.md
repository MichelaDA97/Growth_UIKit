<h1>Growth</h1>

<p>
The idea from which this app was born is to help people to follow a routine of daily habits. 
I tried to replicate the same app that I wrote in <a href="https://github.com/MichelaDA97/MorningGrowth.git">SwiftUI</a>.



In particular, in this project I focused my attention on the UIKit framework and on passing data from SwiftUI to UIKit. 


  The main **features** of this app are:
  - Add activities with a title and duration.
  - Track completed activities by checking them off.
  - View and manage your daily routine.
  - Delete individual activities or clear the entire list.
  - Move tasks between each other to prioritize.


<h2>Usage:</h2>

- **Adding Activities**: Tap the "+" button to add a new activity. Enter the title and duration of the activity (if you don't set the name and/or the time, an alert appears on your screen, only when you close the alert and fill in the empty fields, you can save your own habit), then tap "Save".
  
- **Checking off Activities**: Tap on an activity in the list to mark it as completed. The checkbox next to the activity will toggle between filled (completed) and empty (not completed).
  
- **Deleting Activities**: Swipe left on an activity to reveal the delete button. Tap the delete button to remove the activity from the list.

- **Deleting All Activities**: Tap the "Delete All" button in the navigation bar to remove all activities from the list. A confirmation alert will appear before deleting all activities.

- **Prioritizing Tasks**: Press and hold on an activity, then drag it to a new position in the list to prioritize tasks.

- **Data Persistence**: The app retains the activities in the exact state they were last modified even after you close the application. This ensures that your activities are preserved and accessible across different sessions.

<h2>Requirements:</h2>

- iOS 14.0+
- Xcode 12.0+
- Swift 5.0+
