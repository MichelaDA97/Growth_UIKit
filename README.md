<h1>Growth</h1>

<p>
The idea from which this app was born is to help people to follow a routine of daily habits. 
I tried to replicate the same app that I wrote in SwiftUI. (link)

In particular, in this project I focused my attention on the UIKit framework. 

The main features of this app are:
- Add, delete and move an activity.
- Set the duration of an activity.
- Check an activity.
